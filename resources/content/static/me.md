I'm a mid-twenty enthusiastic web developer and free time gamer from Hamburg, Germany. My core programming language is PHP but also a bit JavaScript if I feel the need.

In my free time I try to create simple games with JavaScript or Unity3D and join the GameJams at InnoGames in Hamburg. I'm also interested in mountain biking and long distance rides.
